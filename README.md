## Problem Definition
1.	Correlate the factors leading to accidents across top 10 aviation companies over the years.
2.	Find the relationship between the factors and the possibility of accident.
3.	Predict the fatality of accident according to the conditions given.

## Models Used
1.	Multi-variate Linear Regression
2.	Random Forest

## Conclusion
1.	Majority of aircraft accidents are Non-fatal accidents 
2.	Majority of the accident involve Reciprocating engine
3.	Higher accident rate in Visual Meteorological conditions but higher survivability rate as well
4.	Most accident prone phases are take-off and landing
5.	Most deadly phases are cruise and maneuvering 
6.	Linear Regression model did not perform well with multi-variate.
7.	Able to classify fatality with Random Forest model with support of tree diagram.

## What did we learn from this project
1.	Time-series plot
2.	DBSCAN clustering algorithm
3.	Folium interactive maps
4.	Cramer’s V correlation matrix
5.	Random forest model
6.	Converting category data to numerical data for classification model
7.	Manipulating data from the original data for model 
8.	Data cleaning can be tough with almost all categorical data
